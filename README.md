# Landing page

This project is a prototype for a static web page designed to meet the specific needs of a local individual business that already has an established network of customers. For this type of business, communicating information such as opening times, prices, etc., can be burdensome because it's not always easy to include it to social networks, however, it doesnt justify the building of a website and the resulting costs. This mobile-friendly landing page acts as a flyer and business card that's easy to share.

## Technologies

HTML - CSS (Bootstrap)

## Aims

This project was set up as part of my training in web development, with the aim of reflecting on how to respond to user needs. It was also included in the "dossier professionnel" that was asked at the exam.
